 	<p>A step by step guide in making the traditional Chinese dessert usually eaten during the Mid Autumn Festival for good luck.</p><br>
 	<p>Step 1<br><b>Making the Dough</b></p>
 			<li>To prepare the dough use a large bowl, mix the golden syrup, water and oil.</li>
 			<li>Sift in the flour</li>
 			<li>Knead into a dough. Cover with film wrap and rest for 40 minutes.</li><br>
 	<p>Step 2<br><b>Preparing the salted egg</b></p>
 			<li>Mix egg yolks with wine. If the salted egg yolks are homemade and freshly broken from the shells, you’ll see the egg whites turn opaque after mixing with the wine a few minutes later.</li>
 			<li>Wipe the yolks dry with kitchen paper. Cut each into two halves. Set aside.</li><br>
 	<p>Step 3<br><b>Prepare the lotus paste</b></p>
 			<li>Roll the lotus paste into a long tube.</li>
 			<li>Cut into 12 equal portions of 35 grams.</li>
 			<li>Roll each portion into a ball shape.</li>
 			<li>Set aside and preheat the oven to 180°C.</li><br>
 	<p>Step 4<br><b>Assembling the Mooncake</b></p>
 			<li>Divide the dough into 12 equal portions. Roll each portion into a small ball shape.</li>
 			<li>Cover a dough portion with a plastic film and roll into a thin disc. Then take a lotus paste ball and poke a hole in the middle with your finger.</li>
 			<li>Place the egg yolk inside and roll and shape into a ball. Wrap and seal the lotus paste ball with the dough disc.</li>
 			<li>Spray the mooncake mould and place the stuffed mooncake into the mould. Lightly press the mould handle, then remove the mooncake from the mould. Transfer the stuffed mooncake onto a lined baking tray. Repeat this step to finish the remaining dough and lotus paste.</li><br>
 	<p>Step 5<br><b>Baking the Mooncake</b></p>
 			<li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 10 to 12 minutes. Continue to bake until the pastry turns golden brown.</li>
 			<li>Remove from oven and leave to cool on a wire rack.</li>
 			<li>Store in an air–tight container. The pastry will become soft and shiny in one or two days: the mooncake recipe is ready to be enjoyed.</li><br>
